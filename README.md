You want to know how lucky you are? Then try this script!



Setup:

1. Install the module "pyautogui"

2. There may be conflictions when the keyboard layout is not set to "us"

(If you are on Wayland you can use the the terminal "ST" from suckless. That way it will still work)

3. Execute the python or bash script in a terminal 

4. See if you are good at gambling


# If you do not understand this script, you shouldn't use it! It could delete everything!
